# Problem 1

### Read & Cleaning Data

``` r
homi_df = read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") |> 
  clean_names() |> 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    # solved = 1; unsolved = 0
    resolved = disposition == "Closed by arrest"
  ) |> 
  # omit the specific cities & Tulsa, AL
  filter(
    !(city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO")),
    !(city == "Tulsa" & state == "AL"),
    victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"),
    !is.na(victim_age),
    !is.na(victim_sex),
    !is.na(resolved)
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White"),   # Reference: White
    victim_sex  = fct_relevel(victim_sex, "Female")    # Reference: Female
  )
```

    ## Rows: 52179 Columns: 12

    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

### Logistic regression for Baltimore

``` r
## Baltimore subset 
baltimore_df =
  homi_df |> 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

## Fit logistic regression
baltimore_fit = glm(
  resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race,
  data   = baltimore_df,
  family = binomial()
)

## Extract adjusted OR comparing male vs female victims
baltimore_or =
  baltimore_fit |> 
  tidy(conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE) |> 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") |> 
  select(term, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)

baltimore_or |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term           | estimate | conf.low | conf.high |
|:---------------|---------:|---------:|----------:|
| victim_sexMale |    0.426 |    0.324 |     0.558 |

### Run glm for all cities & extract ORs

``` r
city_or_results =
  homi_df |> 
  nest(data = -city_state) |> 
  mutate(
    models = map(
      data,
      \(df) glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race,
                data = df, family = binomial())
    ),
    tidied = map(
      models,
      \(mod) tidy(mod, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE)
    )
  ) |> 
  select(city_state, tidied) |> 
  unnest(tidied) |> 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") |> 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high) |> 
  mutate(
    city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)
  )
```

    ## Warning: There were 43 warnings in `mutate()`.
    ## The first warning was:
    ## ℹ In argument: `tidied = map(models, function(mod) tidy(mod, conf.int = TRUE,
    ##   exponentiate = TRUE))`.
    ## Caused by warning:
    ## ! glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred
    ## ℹ Run `dplyr::last_dplyr_warnings()` to see the 42 remaining warnings.

### Plot ORs and CIs for all cities

``` r
city_or_results |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.7) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), width = 0.5) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Adjusted Odds Ratios for Solving Homicides (Male vs Female)",
    subtitle = "Models adjusted for victim age and race",
    x = "City",
    y = "Adjusted OR"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6), lineheight = 0.9)
```

    ## Warning in plot_theme(plot): The `lineheight` theme element is not defined in
    ## the element hierarchy.

#### Comment

The plot shows substantial variation across cities in the adjusted odds
ratio (OR) for solving homicides involving male victims compared to
female victims, controlling for victim age and race.

A number of cities, such as Albuquerque, NM, Stockton, CA, and Fresno,
CA, have ORs well above 1, indicating that cases involving male victims
were more likely to be solved. However, the confidence intervals in
several of these cities are wide, suggesting considerable
uncertainty—likely due to smaller sample sizes or quasi-complete
separation in the logistic models.

In contrast, many large cities—including Baltimore, MD, Chicago, IL,
Cincinnati, OH, and New York, NY—have ORs close to or below 1, and most
of their confidence intervals cross the null value of 1. This implies no
strong evidence of a male–female difference in case resolution rates in
these jurisdictions after adjustment.
